🎬 Movie Rating Prediction with Python
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as:

🎭 Genre

🎬 Director

🎤 Lead Actors

⏳ Duration

📅 Year of Release

🗳️ Number of Votes

By analyzing historical movie data, the model attempts to estimate the user or critic rating of a movie. This regression-based problem provides insights into how different features influence movie ratings.

📊 Objectives
Perform data analysis and visualization

Preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, etc.)

Apply feature engineering techniques

Train and evaluate various regression models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Compare model performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R² Score

Identify and address overfitting issues

🧪 Machine Learning Techniques Used
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

🧠 Insights Gained
XGBoost showed the best performance on training data but signs of overfitting were evident.

Regularization, limiting model complexity, and cross-validation were recommended to reduce overfitting.

Importance of categorical feature encoding and proper scaling was reinforced.

📈 Model Performance Example
Model	MSE	MAE	R² Score
Logistic Regression	1.67	1.04	0.11
Random Forest Regressor	1.18	0.82	0.37
XGBoost Regressor	1.14	0.80	0.39

⚠️ Note: XGBoost had better training performance but showed signs of overfitting.

🔧 Future Improvements
Implement GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Apply L1/L2 Regularization

Use Early Stopping with XGBoost

Integrate SHAP or LIME for model explainability

Deploy as an API using Flask or FastAPI
